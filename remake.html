        <h2>Testimonial</h2>
        <p>Ninjas can kill anyone they want!  Ninjas cut off heads ALL the time and don't even think twice about it.  These guys are so crazy and awesome that they flip out ALL the time.  I heard that there was this ninja who was eating at a diner.  And when some dude dropped a spoon the ninja killed the whole town.  My friend Mark said that he saw a ninja totally uppercut some kid just because the kid opened a window.</p>
        <p>And that's what I call REAL Ultimate Power!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
        <p>If you don't believe that ninjas have REAL Ultimate Power you better get a life right now or they will chop your head off!!!  It's an easy choice, if you ask me.</p>
        <p>Ninjas are sooooooooooo sweet that I want to crap my pants.  I can't believe it sometimes, but I feel it inside my heart.  These guys are totally awesome and that's a fact.  Ninjas are fast, smooth, cool, strong, powerful, and sweet.  I can't wait to start yoga next year.  I love ninjas with all of my body (including my pee pee).</p>

        <h2>Q and A</h2>
        <p>Q: Why is everyone so obsessed about ninjas?</p>
        <p>A: Ninjas are the ultimate paradox. On the one hand they don't give a crap, but on the other hand, ninjas are very careful and precise.</p>
        <p>Q: I heard that ninjas are always cruel or mean. What's their problem?</p>
        <p>A: Whoever told you that is a total liar. Just like other mammals, ninjas can be mean OR totally awesome.</p>
        <p>Q: What do ninjas do when they're not cutting off heads or flipping out?</p>
        <p>A: Most of their free time is spent flying, but sometime they stab.  (Ask Mark if you don't believe me.)</p>
